# PCA

Two definitions of variation:
- The willingness/flexibility of an algorithm to learn.
- Technical term in statistics - the spread of a data distribution. 

PCA finds new coordinate system that's obtained from the old one by translation and rotation only. 
- Find the center of the data.
- This is the center of our new coordinate system. 
- The principal axis is the axis where we see the most variation. 
- y axis is orthagonal to that where less important directions of variation.


Make a `composite feature` that more directly probes the underlying phenomenon.

What is composite feature? ---> Principal Component.

We will use PCA for:
- dimensionality reduction
- unsupervised learning. 

##  How to get PCA?

ðŸ’›Principal component is NOT a linear regression. We are not trying to predict anything.
 
ðŸ’›We are trying to find a direction in the data so that we loose minimum information.

ðŸ’›After finding the principal component, project all data to that new coordinate system.

ðŸ’›For example you can down the dimensionality from 2 to 1 by projection. 

ðŸ’› Principal component of a dataset is the direction that has the largest variance because retains maximum amount of information in original data. 

ðŸ’› Calculate the sum of the distances between the data point and the principal component. --> Information Loss

ðŸ’› PCA is a general algorithm for feature transformation. 

ðŸ’› with PCA you can find that there are k things that drive the target value. 

ðŸ’› Use principal components as new features.

ðŸ’› Principal components are ranked with the variance, the mst variant the first principal component, the next one is second principal component, etc.

ðŸ’› All principal components are orthogonal to each other, they don't overlap. 

ðŸ’› max number of principal components = number of fetures. 


##  When to use it?

- Is there a latent feature?
- Dimensionality reduction
    - It is hard to visualize high dim data. 
    - reduce noise
    - make other algorithms (regression or classification) work better. 
    - eigenfaces
